## Summary

My first forray into C# and really getting to use OOP for the first time. This whole project was a lot of fun for me,
making the game logic, making the UI and adding color, as well as using classes to seperate different parts of the
program. I feel after this project that my understanding of code and code principles has been increased significantly.
This is still only the beginning and I am excited to continue learning every day.
